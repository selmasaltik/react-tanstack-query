**What Is TanStack Query?**

A library that helps sending HTTP requests & keeping your frontend UI in sync

***You Donâ€™t Need TanStack Query!***

But it can vastly simplify your code (and your life as a developer)

**TanStack Query Does *Not Send HTTP* Requests**

At least **not on its own**

**You** have to write the code that sends the actual HTTP request

TanStack Query then manages the **data, errors, caching & much more!**

**TanStack Query Caches Query Data**
